Jan 2025

## 📰 Project Overview

Fake news has become a serious issue in today’s digital world, impacting public opinion and trust.
This project aims to build a **Fake News Detection System** using **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques.

The system classifies news articles as **real** or **fake** by analyzing their textual content.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Complete end-to-end pipeline: dataset collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
* Text cleaning and preprocessing using NLTK.
* Feature extraction via TF-IDF vectorization.
* Model training with Logistic Regression for binary classification.
* Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Real-time news classification through user input interface.
* Easily extendable for other classification models and datasets.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK
* TF-IDF Vectorizer
* Logistic Regression

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:
[Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

It contains labeled news articles with the following structure:

* `title`: Title of the news article
* `author`: Author of the article
* `text`: Full text of the article
* `label`: 0 for real news, 1 for fake news

## 📝 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

```bash
jupyter notebook Fake_News_Detection.ipynb
```

4. Follow the notebook sections for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and real-time prediction.

---

## 📈 Results

* Achieved high accuracy on validation data using Logistic Regression.
* Model successfully detects fake news with good precision and recall.
* Confusion matrix and classification report included in the notebook.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Incorporate deep learning models like LSTM or transformers (BERT).
* Expand real-time prediction to a web or mobile app interface.
* Use larger, more diverse datasets for training.
* Add explainability features to understand model decisions.
